    "prompt": "Create a 3D first-person view of a restaurant kitchen in arcade style for a restaurant worker simulator game. The scene should include:\nLeft side: professional espresso machine made of stainless steel with chrome details, control buttons, and cup placement area.\nCenter-left: industrial gas stove with 4 burners, pans and pots on top. The stove should look commercial-grade with cast iron grates.\nCenter: work surface with 6 small open ingredient containers/drawers (2 rows of 3), showing different burger ingredients - lettuce leaves, sliced tomatoes, onions, cheese, pickles. Each container is clearly separated and contains one type of ingredient.\nRight side: large industrial refrigerator made of stainless steel with vertical handles.\nStyle: bright arcade-like, slightly cartoonish with clear textures. Warm kitchen lighting. First-person perspective as if the player is standing in front of the workstation. All objects should look interactive and functional.",
